                        The 'optional AP' is also the name of college-level courses taught in high schools, and the AP diploma is accepted globally at top universities. In countries like India, where national boards do not offer APs as an addition to the high school curricula,

                    <b> SAT discards subject tests & essay to 'reduce burden', 50 mins shorter now</b>
                    <p> Mumbai: The College Board, the New York-based organization that runs the Scholastic Aptitude Test, has scrapped its subject tests and announced its decision to do away with the optional essay, thus making the main SAT 50 minutes shorter
                        in duration, reports Hemali Chhapia. Candidates are admitted based on SAT scores for undergraduate admissions in the US and to 40 universities in India, private and deemed. The subject tests were 20 multiple-choice standardized.
                        In case of the essay too, top universities have found that essay scores, submitted separately, are not useful or essential for admission. Currently, most Ivy League colleges do not require the essay scores in the SAT score docket.<br>"We're

                        of Tracxn, commented, “Despite four consecutive half-year periods of declining funding since H1 2022, we are now showing signs of stabilisation and an upward trend. India’s robust performance as the fourth-highest-funded country
                        in the tech startup ecosystem is encouraging. From emerging developments in retail and enterprise applications to pioneering advancements in financial technology (fintech), Indian startups are transforming industries and driving
                        economic growth.” According to the India Tech Semi-Annual Funding Report H1 2024 by Tracxn, Indian technology (tech) startups raised $4.1 billion in H1 2024, marking a 4 per cent increase from $3.96 billion in H2 2023. However,
                        this represents a 13 per cent decrease compared to the $4.8 billion raised in H1 2023. India, which ranked as the fourth-highest-funded country globally in the tech startup landscape, slipped a position as China advanced in the
                        pecking order in terms of raising higher funds. China raised a total of $6.2 billion in H1 2024, becoming the third-highest funded country. In H1 2023, India had surpassed China to be the third-highest fundraising country globally.
                        The funding landscape across different stages showed varied trends: seed-stage funding increased to $455 million, up by 6.5 per cent from H2 2023 but down 17.3 per cent from H1 2023. Early-stage startups maintained steady funding
                        of $1.3 billion, consistent with H2 2 3.8 per cent increase from H2 2023, althou$275 million Series F round.
