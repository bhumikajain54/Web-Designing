                    <font size="5px">The 'optional AP' is also the name of college-level courses taught in high schools, and the AP diploma is accepted globally at top universities. In countries like India, where national boards do not offer APs as an addition to the
                        high school curricula, independent centres will allow candidates to take the AP programme and the test to prove their academic prowess in top universities. The College Board, in a statement released to the press, said, "The expanded
                        reach of AP and its widespread availability means the subject tests are no longer necessary for students to show what they know." Top univs have found that essay scores, submitted separately, are not useful or essential for admission.
                        Most Ivy Leagues don't require the essay scores in the SAT score docket."The pandemic has shown us that colleges and universities have been able to admit students by looking at their high school grades, extracurricular activities
                        and holding Interviews," Gupta said. In case of the essay too, top universities have found that essay scores, submitted separately, are not useful or essential for admission. Currently, most Ivy League colleges do not require the
                        essay scores in the SAT score docket.

                    <p> Mumbai: The College Board, the New York-based organization that runs the Scholastic Aptitude Test, has scrapped its subject tests and announced its decision to do away with the optional essay, thus making the main SAT 50 minutes shorter
                        in duration, reports Hemali Chhapia. Candidates are admitted based on SAT scores for undergraduate admissions in the US and to 40 universities in India, private and deemed. The subject tests were 20 multiple-choice standardized.
